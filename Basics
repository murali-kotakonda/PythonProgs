setup:
------------------
download the python:

download community version for  pycharm:

Python:
---------
->simple
[ easy to learn, write, read ]
-> Supports both procedural programming + Object oriented programming
-> interpretor [ compilation + execution ] convert from HLL to machine progrmming.
-> no data type specification.
-> ; is optional , [statement termination]


other lang:                                 python
--------------------------------------------------
int x = 90;                                 x = 90
// int is dt                                // 90 is value
//x is variable                             // then datatype of x is int
// 90 is value

x= "hi";                                     x="cost of 90"
                                            // cost of 90 is value
                                            // data type of x is str

conclusion:
the same veriable dynamically can point to  data  of any data type

-> to run prog in other langs :
   1.compile all 100 lines
   2. run each line
   run the prog is possbile only if compilation is successful.

-> to run prog in python lang :
   1.compile line and run the line
    run the prog is possbile evn if  there is a  compilation .

-> expressive language
-> cross-platform
->free & open source
-> biggest library/ frameworks
->integrated with c/c++/java
->python acts as programming lang + scripting lang
-> python supports programming + automation testing(selenium)
-> apps:
a) GUI
B)web apps
C)WEB services
d)Scientific apps
e)Data science or AI or ML or IOT
f)enterprise apps ( bidadata, content , stream, 3D cad , image processing)

-> Target audience:
  Developers
  testers
  scripting dev
  R&D
  analyst
  datascientist
  dev ops
